## Description
Eatable is a web based restaurant reservation system which allows Restaurateurs to connect with potential customers as well as manage reservations and food orders.  It was developed by a six person team, over a period of three months, as the capstone project for CSC648: Software Engineering at San Francisco State University.  The project was implemented in HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, Javascript, JQuery, and PHP.  The framework follows the Model View Controller architectural pattern and was designed and implemented completely in-house by the back-end team, with specific concern for maintainability and scalability in mind.
